          AEGEE is one of Europe's biggest interdisciplinary student
          organisations, striving for a democratic, diverse and borderless

          <p>
            Three times a year all AEGEE-locals come together somewhere in
            Europe for a week to discuss how things are going, make future plans
            and, ofcourse, party every night. Not only is it very fun, you make
            a lot of friends throughout all Europe this way.

          <p>
            No, summer universities are not boring and do not contain studying.
            They are an exchange program where you travel somewhere for a week
            and meet all kinds of AEGEE members. There are all kinds of SUâ€™s
            ranging from historical tours throuh countries to hikes across
            mountains to drinking holidays.

          <p>
            AEGEE-Passau is an AEGEE local on the Germany-Austria border. They
            are very special to us since they are our twin-local. This means
            that they attend our christmas dinner and we attend their boat
            party. We have very close relations to them and we love visting them
            and having them visit us.
